Please note that the above test cases are hypothetical and may not apply to your specific application or system. They are provided as an example of how to format your test cases according to your specifications. You should replace them with your actual test cases. Also, the estimates are arbitrary and should be replaced with your actual estimates. The steps and expected results are also simplified for the purpose of this example and should be replaced with detailed steps and expected results for your specific test cases. The priority is also arbitrary and should be replaced with your actual priorities. The types of testing are also examples and you should use the types of testing that are relevant to your application or system. The preconditions are also examples and should be replaced with the actual preconditions for each test case. The title of each test case should be descriptive and relevant to the test case. The number of test cases is also arbitrary and you should replace it with the actual number of test cases you need. The separator used is a semicolon (;) as per your specifications. The format is compatible with Testrail. The test cases do not contain any extra blank lines and do not contain any testing type values in the descriptions.
